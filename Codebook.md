## The Data
The UCI HAR Dataset include measurements from a smartphone's motion sensors for several test subjects doing specific activites.

The UCI HAR Dataset can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Detailed information about the raw data and experimental design is included with the dataset.

### Experimental Design
Test subjects were asked to perform certain activities while smartphone gyroscope data was recorded. For more information see the raw dataset's codebook.

### Variables
Variables in tidy set are average values for each subject for each activity. Average was calculated as the mean of the data.

Variables extracted in the tidy dataset include

## Data Cleaning
Data was extracted from the UCI HAR Dataset. Extracted dataset includes data from the raw dataset's training- and testing- subsets.
Tidy data includes a subset of the variables available in the raw data. Tidy data is average values for each test subject and each activity for the subset of variables.

### Selected Variables
